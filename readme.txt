The 'final' folder includes the backend of my project and the 'finalapp' includes the front end.

The backend is built using Django and the frontend is built using Vue.js (Vite).

This project hasn't been hosted, therefore in order to view the application please follow these steps.

Backend

1. Open a terminal and set up an environment (miniconda or anaconda).
2. Inside the terminal go to /final directory.
3. (Make sure pip is installed) run the command: 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
4. Apply migrations using the command: 'python manage.py migrate'
5. Run the server using the command: 'python manage.py migrate'

Frontend

1. Open a terminal and set up an environment (miniconda or anaconda).
2. Inside the terminal go to /finalapp directory.
3. (Make sure npm is installed) run the command: 'npm install'.
4. Start the vue environment using the command: 'npm run dev'.

Now you should be able to access my application.
